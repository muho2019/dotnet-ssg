Welcome to my new blog! This is my very first post, generated using my custom .NET Static Site Generator.

I've been working on this project to learn more about:
*   **Static Site Generation:** The process of building HTML files in advance, which are then served directly to users. This offers great performance and security benefits.
*   **Markdown for Content:** Writing content in a simple, readable format that can be easily converted to HTML.
*   **.NET Development:** Leveraging the power and flexibility of .NET for various tasks, including text processing, file operations, and templating.
*   **Scriban Templating:** An amazing templating engine that allows for dynamic content injection into static HTML layouts.

I'm excited to share my journey and insights here. Stay tuned for more updates!
